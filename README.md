# HUUTRI does dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how tou personalize your system and these are mine.

I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about (which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too)

## what's inside
 
There will be a lot of stuff. Seriosly, a lot of stuff.

## Toolset
- [oh-my-zsh]
- [vim]
- [tmux]
- [git]
